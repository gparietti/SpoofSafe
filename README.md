# SpoofSafe

This project demonstrates how easily a simple ESP8266 can create a fake Wi-Fi network (spoofing) that mimics a real one and tricks users into entering sensitive credentials. The goal is to raise awareness about recognizing insecure connections and protecting personal data.

## üìö Libraries Used

This project uses the following libraries for ESP8266 development:

- `DNSServer.h`  
  Provides DNS server capabilities used to redirect all DNS requests to the captive portal.

- `ESP8266WebServer.h`  
  Implements the web server to serve web pages and handle HTTP requests from clients.

- `ESP8266WiFi.h`  
  Enables Wi-Fi functions, including creating an access point and managing connections.
